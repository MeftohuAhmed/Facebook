# 🚀 Enhancing Facebook's Cross-Platform Integration: A Hypothetical Engineering Feat

## 🌟 Introduction
In this imaginative scenario, I take on the role of a developer within Facebook's engineering team. My focus is on enhancing the integration of Facebook with its sister platforms, including Instagram. This fictional narrative is about creating seamless connectivity and sharing capabilities across these platforms, while emphasizing operational efficiency and robust content moderation.

## 🧩 The Challenge
In this hypothetical setting, I am tasked with a multifaceted challenge: not just coding, but also improving the intricacies of platform integration. The objective is to refine API rate limiters, minimize redundant requests, and bolster content moderation for a safer and more enjoyable user experience.

## 🌍 Challenges That Define My Role
Here's a glimpse into the challenges I envisioned developing to tackle these integration challenges:

🔍 Challenge #1: **Discovering Friend Circles on Facebook**

To enhance social networking experiences, we need to efficiently find all the people within each user’s friend circle on Facebook. This involves identifying direct and transitive friendships among users, ultimately determining the total number of friend circles across the platform.

🌐 Challenge #2: **Duplicating Friend Circles for Instagram**

After identifying friend circles on Facebook, we must replicate this data onto Instagram's servers. Each Facebook user will be assigned a unique ID to differentiate them, ensuring accurate representation of connections on both platforms.

🔄 Challenge #3: **Synchronizing Stories Across Platforms**

Enabling seamless story viewing experiences, this challenge involves accessing and displaying Facebook stories on Instagram. Stories uploaded on Facebook are assigned unique incremental IDs, which need to be efficiently retrieved and watched on Instagram, ensuring a smooth storytelling experience.

📊 Challenge #4: **Throttling Status Requests**

Implementing a throttling mechanism for the Facebook Status API requests, we aim to limit requests for a particular Status ID within a predefined time interval. Requests exceeding this limit will be dropped, enhancing operational efficiency and resource management. Requests for different Status IDs can occur concurrently but are subject to the same time constraints to prevent overload.
